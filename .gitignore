# This .gitignore file should be placed at the root of your Unity project directory.
#
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
#
# For a new project, it's recommended to create this file before making your first commit.
# If you've already committed files that should be ignored, you'll need to remove them
# from the Git index using: `git rm --cached <file>`

# --- Visual Studio / Rider / VS Code ---
# General IDE specific files and directories

# Visual Studio cache directory
.vs/

# Visual Studio Code settings
.vscode/

# JetBrains Rider/IntelliJ IDEA specific
.idea/ # Covers Rider's project-specific settings directory
*.iml # IntelliJ module files

# Gradle cache directory (relevant if doing Android builds)
.gradle/

# Autogenerated Solution and Project files (Unity regenerates these)
# While *.csproj and *.sln are often ignored for Unity, some teams prefer to track
# them IF they ensure no user-specific paths are committed and manage conflicts carefully.
# The standard practice for Unity is to ignore them.
ExportedObj/ # If you export .obj files to this root folder
# .consulo/ # Specific to Consulo IDE
*.csproj
*.unityproj
*.sln
*.suo # Solution User Options - specific to user's VS environment
*.tmp
*.user # User-specific project settings
*.userprefs # User-specific preferences (MonoDevelop/Xamarin Studio)
*.pidb # MonoDevelop/Xamarin Studio project user data
*.booproj # Boo project files (legacy)
*.svd # Not standard, possibly a specific tool's output
*.VC.db # Visual C++ database file, usually related to IntelliSense for C++

# --- Build artifacts and C# specific ---

# Compiled C# files (executables, libraries, debug symbols)
# Unity handles its own build output into the Library, Temp, obj, Build, Builds folders
# but if you have other C# projects alongside Unity, these are good general ignores.
# For Unity, `/[Oo]bj/` and `/[Bb]uild/`, `/[Bb]uilds/` already cover most of this.
# If you have non-Unity C# projects *inside* your Unity repo, you might use these more broadly:
# [Bb]in/
# [Oo]bj/ # Already covered for Unity's root Obj by /[Oo]bj/

# Debug symbols
*.pdb
*.mdb # Mono Debug Symbols

# Database files that can be regenerated
*.opendb # e.g., SQLite apen database

# --- Unity-specific generated files ---

# Unity3D generated meta files for files that are themselves ignored
# (e.g., if you ignore *.pdb, you should also ignore *.pdb.meta)
*.pidb.meta
*.pdb.meta
*.mdb.meta

# Unity3D generated file on crash reports
sysinfo.txt

# --- Build Outputs ---
# Specific build artifacts for various platforms
*.apk # Android package
*.aab # Android App Bundle
